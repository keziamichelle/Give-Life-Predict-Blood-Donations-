*Blood Donation Predictor*

Blood Donation Predictor is a machine learning project aimed at predicting blood donation outcomes. Using features such as recency of donation, frequency of donations, total blood donated, and time since first donation, the model predicts the likelihood of future blood donations. The project leverages a decision tree classifier within a robust machine learning pipeline.
